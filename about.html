            <h3 class="about-text">Art Journey</h3>
            <p class="texty">Year 2016, I was 8 years old, one day I was playing 
                some indoor games, and I saw my father coming with 
                a box full of notebooks, drawingbooks, pencils, pens,
                and colors. this was first time when I was seeing some
                stuff. which can be a lot of helpful..of course enjoying 
                for me i took a notebook and started to draw dolls. that 
                was like so beginner style people. but as I was so excited
                i ignored how bad I'm at drawing and that was the evening 
                which made me today's Artist. day by day I draw and filled the 
                notebook, I also drew some Dragons, Buildings and Tech related
                stuff. in two years my practice made me able to draw poster 
                for my class and for 2 years I decorated my classrooms with posters.
                Years spent and I achieved the heights of Artistry. finally in 
                2023 I started to create a notebook once another time and I drew
                some Rubics Cubes, Minecraft Characters and many more kind of 
                drawings and as always I lost my second notebook so fortunate ufff..The 
                time payback in 2024 my friend drew a South Indian Actor(Rocking Star Yash),
                and started to bright up in the friendzone not bearable now...I didn't went to 
                school and started to draw a famous Scenrio of Marvel Studios, The last Words 
                of Iron Man I spent 3+ hours to complete it and that day my eraser almost turned
                black from white due to erasing. Hands tired to hold pencil but the Ego doesn't let 
                me give up and at the last I made what I wanted. and this moment made me sure
                that Artistry is what who needs patience not quick result and that 
                day I declared myself as an Artist.
